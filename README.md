# Tiny Programs

Learning a new language can be hard. Developers go to "Hello World"
but this is so trivial a program to be almost useless.

This project is a collection of tiny programs that may help you learn
a language. It is similar to Rosetta Code except that all programs
here will be *implementations* and not just library calls.

# Programs

* JSON: A JSON parser for all of JSON except decimal numbers
* Brainfuck: A complete Brainfuck implementation
* Lisp: A tree-walking s-expression interpreter capable of running a fibonacci function
* UUID: A UUIDv4 generator
* HTTP: An HTTP server from UNIX sockets
* RBTree: A red-black tree

# Contributing an implementation

Do not copy any existing code. Write the program from scratch and keep
it simple. Use existing implementations as guidelines. Avoid
programming patterns and object-oriented design and functional
programming for the sake of patterns and OOP and FP. Just keep it
simple.

## Call for languages

Would be great to have ports for:

* Ada
* FreePascal
* FreeBASIC
* R
* Octave
* Common Lisp
* Swift
* Kotlin
* Scala
* Clojure
* Lua
* C++
* D
* Zig
